## My Project

This is a simple task-management app

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and run the Task Management App locally:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/task-management-app.git
cd task-management-app
```

### 2. Install backend dependencies

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

-Configure environment variables (e.g., database URL) in a .env file if required.

-Example .env (adjust as needed):
DATABASE_URL=""
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=""
REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET=""

### 3. Migrate and Generate the prisma client

```bash
npx prisma init
npx prisma migrate dev
npx prisma generate
```

4. Start the Backend Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

5 Install Client Dependencies

- Open a new terminal

```bash
cd client
npm install
```

6 Start the Client App

- Open a new terminal

```bash
npm run dev
```

## 🧠 Approach Explanation

This Task Management App is designed using a **modular full-stack architecture** to ensure scalability, maintainability, and clear separation of concerns.

### 🔹 Folder Structure

- **`/client`** – Frontend built with Next js. Handles user interaction, task views, and communication with the backend via REST API.
- **`/backend`** – Backend built with Node.js and Express (or another backend stack). Manages business logic, data persistence, and user authentication.

### 🔹 Core Features Implemented

- **Task CRUD operations** – Create, read, update, and delete tasks.
- **User management** – Optional login system to associate tasks with specific users.
- **Persistent storage** – Uses MongoDB (or SQL) to store tasks and user data.
- **Real-time UI updates** – Client fetches data through REST APIs and updates UI dynamically.
- **Error handling & validation** – Ensures clean input and reliable performance.

### 🔹 Development Workflow

1. Backend API endpoints are developed and tested using tools like Postman.
2. Client consumes these APIs to present interactive task interfaces to the user.
3. App is styled with a utility-first CSS framework (like Tailwind) or custom CSS.

This approach ensures a clean separation of frontend and backend responsibilities, making the app easier to maintain and scale as more features are added.
